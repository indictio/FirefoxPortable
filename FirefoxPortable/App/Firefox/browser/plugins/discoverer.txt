Open your Firefox browser and type about:config as URL
Find out the entry plugins.load_appdir_plugins, and right click it, then choose Toogle to change its value from False to True

Create folder plugins under C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\browser\ -> merge si pe Portabil
Copy file C:\Program Files\Oracle\JInitiator 1.1.8.16\bin\NPJinit-11816.dll to C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\browser\plugins\ folder
